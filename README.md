## Project Description: Customer-Based Collaborative Filtering using RFM Segments, TF-IDF, and Cosine Similarity

Objective: To generate personalized product recommendations for customers by leveraging RFM segmentation, TF-IDF scores, and cosine similarity.

### Steps:

#### RFM Segmentation:
Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores for each customer.
Segment customers based on these scores to identify distinct cohorts with similar purchasing behavior.
#### TF-IDF Representation:
Create cohort-specific TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representations of product descriptions.
The TF-IDF scores capture the importance of terms in the context of product descriptions within each customer segment.
#### Cosine Similarity:
Calculate cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors for products within the same cohort.
Cosine similarity measures how similar the product descriptions are to each other, which aids in identifying products of interest for customers in each segment.
#### Recommendation Generation:
Use the cosine similarity scores to generate personalized product recommendations tailored to individual customers based on their cohortâ€™s preferences and purchasing behavior.
#### Outcome: 
Deliver a recommendation system that provides relevant product suggestions by analyzing customer segments and matching product descriptions using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
